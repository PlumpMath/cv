{\bf Overview:}

With over two decades of experience in high energy physics and particle astrophysics, I am a software engineer specializing in experimental physics and other high-performance computing environments.  My recent work for the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole includes several critical components of the detector's data acquisition system and an innovative, end-to-end implementation of the experiment control system, in production since early 2009.  I also play a key role in troubleshooting and maintaining that detector during calibration and normal operations (\textgreater 99\% uptime).

It is a passion of mine to address difficult computing problems in science, problems which may engage multiple challenges in terms of computability, complexity, scalability, and usability.  I am particularly interested in using modern, high-level programming languages (such as Python, Clojure, and other functional languages), to create simple, beautiful, usable and powerful systems for the collection, analysis and visualization of data on the frontiers of science.
